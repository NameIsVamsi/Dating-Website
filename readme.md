Brief Description

Over the last 20 years, technology has changed. The way people communicate has changed. But one thing that remains the same is eharmony’s mission: to create meaningful connections which lead to long-term love.

	Here we as a Team has developed the project naming  "Dating Site" with all the required functionality like PHP , W3CSS. Here we are providing several fucntionalities to the user like Registering into our Website followed by logging and allowed the main parts like getting connection with their ideal partners and have fun.

We have worked as a Team and this is how we have dustributed the work by ourselves:

Vamsi Krishna: developed the regular user,premium user whole send message, send wink functionality by creating and storing the messages and winks into a table along with the current time stamp, and have also developed the add and remove favourites for the premium user by maintining the favourite users for every username in a separate database and pushing the updates into notifications tab i.e, showing if someone has added them or removed them from their favourite list.

Deep sethwora: designed the idea for the dating site,database and the flow of this site, the user experience of the site.

Raj Patel:  developed the search functionality by fetching the data based on the string provided in the textbox for all types of users and have written php files to update the profiles by fethcing them from database and updating in the correct column using sql joins and have worked on the styling of the whole website and the static html content like fixed headers for temp,regular and premium user. Have added a flag called premium to users table so that while logging in we can check and load the regular/premium home page accordingly.

Jestin Mathews Kurian: developed the login,register and the default home page by loading and storing data into users table and view profiles by fetching the data from the database according to the desired gender and displayed them in nice grids by fetching the images,username and added them to the hidden field of the form so that we can access them from another file.(used sql joins to fetch data from both profiles and users tables) 


We are taking this space to thank you for giving us an opportuinity to work on a Real life project and we have put our maximum effort to fullfill all requirements.
